Overview: Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, with support from Google, is facilitating a comprehensive security review for git, a critical piece of open-source technology. There are multiple work packages and teams performing a variety of security related tasks and improvements. This document serves as a guide for that work. 

Three main work packages being executed:

#1 - Git source code review and threat modeling: This will be done by the team at x41 d-sec with support from Gitlab reps.

#2 - Supply chain security / CI infrastructure review with Chainguard and support from Gitlab.

#3 - Static source code vulnerability analysis using [CodeQL](https://github.codeql.com) (facilitated by @xcorail & @turbo)

## Connect with git contributor community for advice and guidance:

Result from 8/1 Git Standup: 

A number of people participated in the 8/1 Git Standup and the git contributor community was extremely helpful and welcoming. An overview of that conversation can be found here: https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/git-devel?date=2022-08-01


Next Steps: 

[] Create Communication Matrix
[] Run communication matrix by contributor community 
[] Establish direct channels with contributors most closely related to respective work package
