Overview: Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, with support from Google, is facilitating a comprehensive security review for git, a critical piece of open-source technology. There are multiple work packages and teams performing a variety of security related tasks and improvements. This document serves as a guide for that work. 

Three main work packages being executed:

Git source code review and threat modeling: This will be done by the team at x41 d-sec with support from Gitlab reps.


Supply chain security / CI infrastructure review with Chainguard and support from Gitlab.
