### Executive Summary ###

The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) is striving to create a Managed Audit Program (MAP) to secure critical projects in the open source ecosystem. OSTIF draws on 10+ years of experience managing audits for open source projects, an international network of trust and rapport, and comprehensive support that results in improved security tooling, closed classes of bugs, and published research. The Program serves the following objectives:
	
  1.	Creating and executing on a solution focused on going to the source of the problem and incrementally solving it.
  2.	Demonstrating strong collaboration and action taken toward fulfilling the mission of securing the open source ecosystem.
  3.	Recognizing the organizations funding this work to increase awareness and investment in this space.
  
### Current Status ###

OSTIF is currently in the process of securing and processing OpenSSF's grant and Google's grant. Furthermore, initial scoping and planning for the first Security Reviews under the Managed Audit Program are underway.


### History ###

OSTIF has been participating in the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) and pitched the Managed Audit Program to the Securing Critical Projects workgroup. The Pitch included a budget to fully fund a year of running the program at full capacity. The pitch was then made to the OpenSSF Technical Advisory Council (TAC) to fund the Program. The TAC approved a small grant for OSTIF to prove the concept and demonstrate results, which was then approved by the OSSF Governing Board (GB). Google, a founding member of OpenSSF, demonstrated strong interest in the program and directly provided a modest grant to further help stand up the Managed Audit Program and begin to secure critical open source projects.
