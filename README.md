# OSTIF-Security-Reviews
## Security Work and Manual Reviews facilitated by Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, aka OSTIF. 

Short Description of Organization: 

The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund is a corporate non-profit dedicated to securing open source apps that we all depend on. Securing software isn’t easy, and we know what it takes to succeed. By facilitating security audits and reviews, OSTIF makes it easy for projects to significantly improve security.

Preview of results:

Linux Kernel

OSTIF facilitated a coalition of experts to review the Linux Kernel’s practices and policies around how security vulnerabilities are reported to the kernel team, how those reports are processed and addressed, and how those vulnerabilities are disclosed to the public.
